					<h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
					COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, 
					but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of 
					illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, 
					returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being 
					infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical 
					conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and 
					effective. Two of the relatively new variants of COVID-19 are Delta and Omicron.

					<h3>Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?</h3>
					Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands
					often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or 
					sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily 
					available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h3>What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?</h3>
					People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms - from mild symptoms to severe illness. 
					Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, 
					you might have COVID-19.
